# 0­3 is Arts & Entertainment

# the meantime, you can query each such category in the Trends Explore
# frontend, by hitting on "embed" after you've chosen a category for
# a query and copying what's written next to: &cat=
# Parameter name is restrictions_category.

# Property takes the values: images/news/froogle/youtube/web
# Web is the default value if none is provided, and 'froogle' is
# Google Shopping.
# Parameter name is restrictions_property.
